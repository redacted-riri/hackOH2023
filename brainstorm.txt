Honda Challenge:
pathfinding
non-gps options for precision
if you know the space already, can potentially use known acceleration to predict where you will end up
ping devices by having devices in the building to triangulate (wouldn't work in concrete buildings)
high traffice and data usage would affect space
SLAM algorithm? 
Wifi router boxes to triangulate (schools have around 65 for reference so there are plenty to use for this)
Looking up triangulating based on wifi signals
