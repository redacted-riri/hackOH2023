Hi we are ....

Our project was for the Honda challenge focused on improving interior navigation. We thought of the biggest issues of
navigation indoors, mainly that GPS struggles to work as precisely and reliably. Our solution was then to look for solutions
that would have the least reliance on external factors, and we managed to come up with a solution that doesn't require any network access
at all.
